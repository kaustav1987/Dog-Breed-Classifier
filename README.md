# Dog-Breed-Classifier
In this project, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any user-supplied image. If the image is of a human and not a dog, the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

The code is written in Python 3  and pytorch.
